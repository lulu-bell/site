  <div class="about-content">
    <p>
      I am an affliate member of the Ontario Association of counsellors, consultants, psychotherapists and Psychomistraist.  I began my counselling career over 15 years ago working in nonprofit  and healthcare organizations providing counselling and crisis intervention to a diverse group of people. I have worked with men, women, older adults and  I am now interested in working with you.
    </p>

    <p>
      Drawing on a vast knowledge of approaches, including Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, Narrative Therapy and Motivational interviewing we will work together to address your concerns and help you move forward.
    </p>

    <p>
      As a counsellor I offer brief, or longer term counselling depending on your need, I am available for one session, a series or on an as needed basis.

  <h2 id="counselling">What is counselling</h2>
  <div class="about-content">
    <strong>Counselling is a type of talking therapy that allows a person to talk about their problems and feelings in a confidential and safe environment.
    </strong>
    <p>
      A counsellor is trained to listen with empathy (by putting themselves in your shoes). They can help you deal with any negative thoughts and feelings you have.
    </p>
    <p>
       I think the expense of therapy is only worthwhile if it works and is effective. Because I really care about my work and my patients and want to see them improve their lives, I make the commitment to every patient that I will work as hard as I can to help create the changes you seek. You will receive compassionate care and a high level of customer service. Evaluating the effectiveness of psychotherapy can also happen in the therapy itself on an ongoing basis, in order to assess whether its worthwhile for you and your family.
