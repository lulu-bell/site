&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“Out of clutter, find simplicity.
From discord, find harmony.
In the middle of difficulty lies opportunity.”  -Albert Einstein&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this new year you are in a quest to simplify ensure it is your unique definition of simplicity that drives you not the newest book, article or post.  Check in with your values to guide your choices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1&gt;Let’s Celebrate Our Mistakes&lt;/h1&gt;
January 03, 2018
&lt;/header&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other day I saw an interaction between a pre-schooler and her mother. The child made a small speech error when corrected, she recognize her error said “oops a mistake” then she started to dance and sing ‘We  Celebrate Our Mistakes, We Celebrate Our Mistakes. ‘  It was spectacular!  The confidence that learning happened from mistakes at such a young age.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A beautiful reminder that we all need to take risks, learn and try again.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc" /><summary>Let’s Celebrate Our Mistakes

&lt;h1&gt;Happy New Year 2018&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;/header&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is 2018!  The New Year often is a time for self reflection this can be a positive experience for some. You maybe celebrating your journey so far and considering what is next for you.  For some, it  involves measuring your self  based on where your think you should be, based on your bench marks or maybe others expectations.  Maybe you don’t even know what your goals are. This New Years I encourage you to be self-compassionate, be kind and friendly to your self. Remember that what ever you are struggling with you are not alone in your struggle, many others are struggling too.  Try to bring a mental curiosity and empathy to your feelings, thoughts and body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this in mind I wish you a peaceful and joyful New Year.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc" /><summary>Happy New Year 2018
