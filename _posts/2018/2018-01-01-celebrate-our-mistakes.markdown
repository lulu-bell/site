The other day I saw an interaction between a pre-schooler and her mother. The child made a small speech error when corrected, she recognize her error said “oops a mistake” then she started to dance and sing ‘We  Celebrate Our Mistakes, We Celebrate Our Mistakes. ‘  It was spectacular!  The confidence that learning happened from mistakes at such a young age.

A beautiful reminder that we all need to take risks, learn and try again.
